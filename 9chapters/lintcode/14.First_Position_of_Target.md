[SOL](https://www.jiuzhang.com/problem/first-position-of-target/) or local.

For a given sorted array (ascending order) and a target number, find the first index of this number in O(log n) time complexity.


If the target number does not exist in the array, return -1.

Example
```
Example 1:
	Input:  [1,4,4,5,7,7,8,9,9,10]，1
	Output: 0
	
	Explanation: 
	the first index of  1 is 0.

Example 2:
	Input: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10]，3
	Output: 2
	
	Explanation: 
	the first index of 3 is 2.

Example 3:
	Input: [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10]，6
	Output: -1
	
	Explanation: 
	Not exist 6 in array.
```

Challenge
If the count of numbers is bigger than 2^32, can your code work properly?
