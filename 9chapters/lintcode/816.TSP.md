Give n cities(labeled from 1 to n), and the undirected road's cost among the cities as a three-tuple [A, B, c](i.e there is a road between city A and city B and the cost is c). We need to find the smallest cost to travel all the cities starting from 1.

1.A city can only be passed once.
2.You can assume that you can reach all the rest cities.


Example
```
Example 1

Input: 
n = 3
tuple = [[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[1,3,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest path is 1->2->3

Example 2

Input:
n = 1
tuple = []
Output: 0
```
