Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

The first data is the root node, followed by the value of the left and right son nodes, and "#" indicates that there is no child node.

The number of nodes does not exceed 20.


Example
```
Example 1:

Input：{1,2,3}
Output：[[1],[2,3]]
Explanation：
  1
 / \
2   3
it will be serialized {1,2,3}
level order traversal

Example 2:

Input：{1,#,2,3}
Output：[[1],[2],[3]]
Explanation：
1
 \
  2
 /
3
it will be serialized {1,#,2,3}
level order traversal
```

Challenge

Challenge 1: Using only 1 queue to implement it.

Challenge 2: Use BFS algorithm to do it.
