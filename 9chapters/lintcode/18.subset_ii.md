Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).

Each element in a subset must be in non-descending order.

The ordering between two subsets is free.

The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.


Example
```
Example 1:

Input: [0]
Output:
[
  [],
  [0]
]

Example 2:

Input: [1,2,2]
Output:
[
  [2],
  [1],
  [1,2,2],
  [2,2],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```
Challenge

Can you do it in both recursively and iteratively?
