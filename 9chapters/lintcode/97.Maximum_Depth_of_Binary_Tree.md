Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

The answer will not exceed 5000

Example
```
Example 1:

Input: tree = {}
Output: 0
Explanation: The height of empty tree is 0.

Example 2:

Input: tree = {1,2,3,#,#,4,5}
Output: 3	
Explanation: Like this:
   1
  / \                
 2   3

   4   5
it will be serialized {1,2,3,#,#,4,5}
```
